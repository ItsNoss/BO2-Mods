# BO2-Mods
These are mods made by or edited by Noss for both Zombies and Multiplayer.

I have provided both the source code and the pre-compiled versions to make it easier for someone that does not want to edit the script.

## Installation
Please follow the instructions by [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw/docs/modding/loading-mods/#t6) to install any of these mods.

## Suggestions
If you have any suggestions, please create an issue with [Suggestion] in the title. I am open to attempting to make any mod but I am still learning GSC.

## Current mods
### Zombies
- Jugg, This mod was inspired by [the mod made to give people jugg when they join on round 8 or later](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/112/release-jugger-for-new-players-joining-at-or-after-round-8-zombies). I decided to give the players jugg if they die or go down as well.
